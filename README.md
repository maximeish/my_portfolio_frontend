# My Portfolio - Maxime Ishimwe

A repository for my brand website

# The portfolio includes a blog as well (all features not fully implemented yet)

> Summary of what this does

- This is a blog system that should allow a user to create and delete their own posts and also view posts written by other users and should be able to comment on them to give them feedback.

- The user should also choose to either subscribe to newletters so that, me as the blog owner, when I post a new article the user is notified via email.

- The user is also able to cancel their subscription status.

- The user is able to update their account information; username, password and he/she is also able to delete his/her account.

# usage

You can either choose to use the *hosted version* at http://dev-maximeish.netlify.app/ or use it manually.

> To opt for manual usage:

- Go to your command line and run **git clone https://github.com/maximeish/mybrand-maxime** to clone this repo to your local machine (make sure you have git installed).

- run **cd mybrand-maxime** to enter the cloned repo and then **git checkout master** to switch to the *master branch* if for some reason you are in another branch. You can also switch to the **develop branch** by *git checkout develop* but be aware that it may contain unstable features that are still experimental.

- You can then open up the **index.html** file in your browser and you should be good to go.

> Summary of what this does

- This is a blog system that should allow a user to create and delete their own posts and also view posts written by other users and should be able to comment on them to give them feedback.

- The user should also choose to either subscribe to newletters so that, me as the blog owner, when I post a new article the user is notified via email.

- The user is also able to cancel their subscription status.

- The user is able to update their account information; username, password and he/she is also able to delete his/her account.

# usage
